Machine learning methods are growing in relevance for
biometrics and personal information processing in domains
such as forensics, e-health, recruitment, and e-learning. In
these domains, white-box (human-readable) explanations of
systems built on machine learning methods can become crucial. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is a subfield of
symbolic AI aimed to automatically learn declarative theories about the process of data. Learning from Interpretation Transition (LFIT) is an ILP technique that can learn
a propositional logic theory equivalent to a given blackbox system (under certain conditions). The present work
takes a first step to a general methodology to incorporate
accurate declarative explanations to classic machine learning by checking the viability of LFIT in a specific AI application scenario: fair recruitment based on an automatic
tool generated with machine learning methods for ranking
Curricula Vitae that incorporates soft biometric information (gender and ethnicity). We show the expressiveness of
LFIT for this specific problem and propose a scheme that
can be applicable to other domains.
