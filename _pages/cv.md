Education
======
* Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, PhD in Formal Methods, 2025 (expected)
* Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, M. Eng. in Formal Methods, 2020
* University of Science and Technology of China, M.Sc. in Cryptography, 2020

Research Experience
======
* IMDEA Software Instritute
  * 2020.09-Present
  * Research Assistant
  * Implemented the security contracts with the RISCV model written in Sail. It can generate contract observation tracts by simulating the model
  * Developed and maintained a tool called ‘LeaVe’ that can verify the security of a processor at RTL for a specific attacker w.r.t a given leakage contract. This work is supported by a grant from Intel Corporation.

* Universidad Autónoma de Madrid
  * 2019.09-2020.09
  * Postgraduate Researcher
  * Coded a demo system for static interval analysis with Python
  * Researched the inductive logic programming approaches, and designed an explainable deep learning system for biometrics
  * Mastered the basic machine learning algorithms and TensorFlow

* University of Science and Technology of China
  * 2013.06-2020.06
  * Research Assistant
  * Analyzed the security of RSA under the lattice cryptoanalysis
  * Designed a lattice-base authenticated key exchange protocol, provided the provable security, and implemented it with python
  * Designed a lattice-base password-based authenticated key exchange protocol and provided the provable security

* Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences
  * 2014.06-2015.09
  * Intern
  * Participated in the project of creating a cryptanalysis platform
  * Coded and tested the “security level of S-box” module of the platform

* Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences
  * 2013.01-2013.06
  * Intern
