Research Experience
======
* IMDEA Software Instritute
  * 2020.09-Present
  * Research Assistant
  * Applied formal methods to verify security at the hardware–software boundary. On a very high level, I formalize the security guarantee of processors with hardware-software contracts at register transfer level (RTL). On software side, programmers write secure programs according to the contract. On hardware side, we prove the contract satisfaction w.r.t the contract, processor and the attacker.
  * Developed a tool called ‘LeaVe’ to verify contract satisfaction. We developed a Houdini-style invariant learning algorithm and implemented it in ‘LeaVe’. For a given contract, hardware and attacker, ‘LeaVe’ can unboundly check the contract satisfaction.
  * Developed a tool called ‘LeaSyn’ to synthesize sound and precise leakage contracts. For a given processor implemented at RTL, ‘LeaSyn’ synthesizes a sound and precise leakage contract w.r.t the attacker. Here, ‘Sound’ means that all leaks at hardware level are captured while ‘precise’ means only actual leaks are exposed.
