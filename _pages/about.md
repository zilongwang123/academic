Biography
======
I am a fourth-year PhD student at the [Universidad Politécnica de Madrid](https://www.upm.es/), where I am fortunate to be supervised by Professor [Professor Marco Guarnieri](https://mguarnieri.github.io/).
I am also an assistant researcher at the [Imdea Software Institute](https://software.imdea.org/es/).
I hold a Master’s degree in Formal Methods from the [Universidad Autónoma de Madrid](https://www.uam.es/uam/inicio) and a second Master’s degree in Cryptography from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).

Research Interests
======
I previously worked on the design of lattice-based post-quantum cryptographic protocols.
My current research focuses on reasoning about and formally verifying security at the hardware–software boundary, with a particular emphasis on microarchitectural attacks and defenses.
