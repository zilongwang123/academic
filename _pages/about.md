Biography
======
I'm a fourth year PhD student from [Universidad Politécnica de Madrid](https://www.upm.es/). I'm very fortunate to be supervised by [Professor Marco Guarnieri](https://mguarnieri.github.io/). I'm also working at [Imdea Software Institute](https://software.imdea.org/es/) as an assistant researcher. I got my master degree in Formal Methods from [Universidad Autónoma de Madrid](https://www.uam.es/uam/inicio) and another master degree in cryptography from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).

Research Interests
======
I previously worked on the design of lattice-based post-quantum cryptographic protocols.
My current research focuses on reasoning about and formally verifying security at the hardware–software boundary, with a particular emphasis on microarchitectural attacks and defenses.
